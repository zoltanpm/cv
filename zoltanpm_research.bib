  abstract = {Recent outbreaks of measles have centered in specific communities, pointing to the influence of social ties on vaccination practices. This study adds to the conversation on public understanding of vaccine-related science, documenting how the individualist epistemologies highlighted in prior research are externalized and validated in communication with others, focusing on how the narrative strategies used to do so contribute to community building among vaccine refusing and hesitant parents. Through qualitative content analysis of testimonials given to the creators of the anti-vaccination documentary VaxXed, we identify how the common narrative strategies used to question the scientific consensus on vaccines—distrust of doctors, self-diagnosis, building credibility, advocacy, and community building—build a competing consensus based on personal expertise. With this approach, we are better able to understand how participation in online communities strengthens the privileging of individualist epistemologies among vaccine refusing and hesitant parents.},

An overwhelming body of evidence demonstrates that conflicts associate with deleterious outcomes for the biomedical research enterprise. Nevertheless, little has changed for research, specifically, since the Institute of Medicine's landmark               Conflicts of Interest in Medical Research, Practice, and Education               was published over a decade ago. In this article, we draw on interdisciplinary research on manufactured controversies in science‐policy deliberation to argue that the development of meaningful COI policy has been stymied through argumentative “wedges” designed to delay consensus and policy formation. Argumentative wedges disrupt policy formation by mischaracterizing the evidence base, continuously redefining the terms of the debate and/or recommending overly narrow criteria for who should be allowed to participate in policy deliberation. In this article, we argue researchers and policymakers interested in better addressing the harmful effects of COI can improve their efforts through strategic efforts designed to disrupt the wedges of manufactured controversy. Additionally, we argue that efforts to address COI can be further enhanced through embracing a broader framework for COI inquiry. Specifically, we argue that aggregate approaches to COI can help to disrupt these wedges and provide a strong foundation for future policy.}

  abstract = {Background: Multiple lines of previous research have documented that author conflicts of interest (COI) can compromise the integrity of the biomedical research enterprise. However, continuing research that would investigate why, how, and in what circumstances COI is most risky is stymied by the difficulty in accessing disclosure statements, which are not widely represented in available databases. Objective: In this study, we describe a new open access dataset of COI disclosures extracted from published biomedical journal papers. Methods: To develop the dataset, we used ClinCalc’s Top 300 drugs lists for 2017 and 2018 to identify 319 of the most commonly used drugs. Search strategies for each product were developed using the National Library of Medicine’s and MeSH (Medical Subject Headings) browser and deployed using the eUtilities application programming interface in April 2021. We identified the 150 most relevant papers for each product and extracted COI disclosure statements from PubMed, PubMed Central, or retrieved papers as necessary. Results: Conflicts of Interest Publication Disclosures (COIPonD) is a new dataset that captures author-reported COI disclosures for biomedical research papers published in a wide range of journals and subspecialties. COIPonD captures author-reported disclosure information (including lack of disclosure) for over 38,000 PubMed-indexed papers published between 1949 and 2022. The collected papers are indexed by discussed drug products with a focus on the 319 most commonly used drugs in the United States. Conclusions: COIPonD should accelerate research efforts to understand the effects of COI on the biomedical research enterprise. In particular, this dataset should facilitate new studies of COI effects across disciplines and subspecialties.},

We used a machine-learning system to extract and classify COI from PubMed-indexed disclosure statements. Individual conflicts were classified as Type 1 (personal fees, travel, board memberships, and non-financial support), Type 2 (grants and research support), or Type 3 (stock ownership and industry employment). COI were aggregated by type compared to adverse events by product. Type 1 COI are associated with a 1.1-1.8\% increase in the number of adverse events, serious events, hospitalizations, and deaths. Type 2 COI are associated with a 1.7-2\% decrease in adverse events across severity levels. Type 3 COI are associated with an approximately 1\% increase in adverse events, serious events, and hospitalizations, but have no significant association with adverse events resulting in death. The findings suggest that COI policies might be adapted to account the relative risks of different types of financial relationships.},

  abstract = {Background               Large language models (LLMs) have the potential to support promising new applications in health informatics. However, practical data on sample size considerations for fine-tuning LLMs to perform specific tasks in biomedical and health policy contexts are lacking.                                         Objective               This study aims to evaluate sample size and sample selection techniques for fine-tuning LLMs to support improved named entity recognition (NER) for a custom data set of conflicts of interest disclosure statements.                                         Methods               A random sample of 200 disclosure statements was prepared for annotation. All “PERSON” and “ORG” entities were identified by each of the 2 raters, and once appropriate agreement was established, the annotators independently annotated an additional 290 disclosure statements. From the 490 annotated documents, 2500 stratified random samples in different size ranges were drawn. The 2500 training set subsamples were used to fine-tune a selection of language models across 2 model architectures (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers [BERT] and Generative Pre-trained Transformer [GPT]) for improved NER, and multiple regression was used to assess the relationship between sample size (sentences), entity density (entities per sentence [EPS]), and trained model performance (F1-score). Additionally, single-predictor threshold regression models were used to evaluate the possibility of diminishing marginal returns from increased sample size or entity density.                                         Results               Fine-tuned models ranged in topline NER performance from F1-score=0.79 to F1-score=0.96 across architectures. Two-predictor multiple linear regression models were statistically significant with multiple R2 ranging from 0.6057 to 0.7896 (all P{$<$}.001). EPS and the number of sentences were significant predictors of F1-scores in all cases ( P{$<$}.001), except for the GPT-2\_large model, where EPS was not a significant predictor (P=.184). Model thresholds indicate points of diminishing marginal return from increased training data set sample size measured by the number of sentences, with point estimates ranging from 439 sentences for RoBERTa\_large to 527 sentences for GPT-2\_large. Likewise, the threshold regression models indicate a diminishing marginal return for EPS with point estimates between 1.36 and 1.38.                                         Conclusions               Relatively modest sample sizes can be used to fine-tune LLMs for NER tasks applied to biomedical text, and training data entity density should representatively approximate entity density in production data. Training data quality and a model architecture’s intended use (text generation vs text processing or classification) may be as, or more, important as training data volume and model parameter size.}
