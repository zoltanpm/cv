	abstract = {Background: Multiple lines of previous research have documented that author conflicts of interest ({COI}) can compromise the integrity of the biomedical research enterprise. However, continuing research that would investigate why, how, and in what circumstances {COI} is most risky is stymied by the difficulty in accessing disclosure statements, which are not widely represented in available databases.
Objective: In this study, we describe a new open access dataset of {COI} disclosures extracted from published biomedical journal papers.
Methods: To develop the dataset, we used {ClinCalc}‚Äôs Top 300 drugs lists for 2017 and 2018 to identify 319 of the most commonly used drugs. Search strategies for each product were developed using the National Library of Medicine‚Äôs and {MeSH} (Medical Subject Headings) browser and deployed using the {eUtilities} application programming interface in April 2021. We identified the 150 most relevant papers for each product and extracted {COI} disclosure statements from {PubMed}, {PubMed} Central, or retrieved papers as necessary.
Results: Conflicts of Interest Publication Disclosures ({COIPonD}) is a new dataset that captures author-reported {COI} disclosures for biomedical research papers published in a wide range of journals and subspecialties. {COIPonD} captures author-reported disclosure information (including lack of disclosure) for over 38,000 {PubMed}-indexed papers published between 1949 and 2022. The collected papers are indexed by discussed drug products with a focus on the 319 most commonly used drugs in the United States.
Conclusions: {COIPonD} should accelerate research efforts to understand the effects of {COI} on the biomedical research enterprise. In particular, this dataset should facilitate new studies of {COI} effects across disciplines and subspecialties.},

              Considerable efforts have been devoted to addressing the problem of conflicts of interest ({COI}) in health research, policy, education, and practice. An overwhelming body of evidence demonstrates that conflicts associate with deleterious outcomes for the biomedical research enterprise. Nevertheless, little has changed for research, specifically, since the Institute of Medicine's landmark
              Conflicts of Interest in Medical Research, Practice, and Education
              was published over a decade ago. In this article, we draw on interdisciplinary research on manufactured controversies in science‚Äêpolicy deliberation to argue that the development of meaningful {COI} policy has been stymied through argumentative ‚Äúwedges‚Äù designed to delay consensus and policy formation. Argumentative wedges disrupt policy formation by mischaracterizing the evidence base, continuously redefining the terms of the debate and/or recommending overly narrow criteria for who should be allowed to participate in policy deliberation. In this article, we argue researchers and policymakers interested in better addressing the harmful effects of {COI} can improve their efforts through strategic efforts designed to disrupt the wedges of manufactured controversy. Additionally, we argue that efforts to address {COI} can be further enhanced through embracing a broader framework for {COI} inquiry. Specifically, we argue that aggregate approaches to {COI} can help to disrupt these wedges and provide a strong foundation for future policy.},

	abstract = {Background
              Large language models ({LLMs}) have the potential to support promising new applications in health informatics. However, practical data on sample size considerations for fine-tuning {LLMs} to perform specific tasks in biomedical and health policy contexts are lacking.
            
            
              Objective
              This study aims to evaluate sample size and sample selection techniques for fine-tuning {LLMs} to support improved named entity recognition ({NER}) for a custom data set of conflicts of interest disclosure statements.
            
            
              Methods
              A random sample of 200 disclosure statements was prepared for annotation. All ‚Äú{PERSON}‚Äù and ‚Äú{ORG}‚Äù entities were identified by each of the 2 raters, and once appropriate agreement was established, the annotators independently annotated an additional 290 disclosure statements. From the 490 annotated documents, 2500 stratified random samples in different size ranges were drawn. The 2500 training set subsamples were used to fine-tune a selection of language models across 2 model architectures (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers [{BERT}] and Generative Pre-trained Transformer [{GPT}]) for improved {NER}, and multiple regression was used to assess the relationship between sample size (sentences), entity density (entities per sentence [{EPS}]), and trained model performance (F1-score). Additionally, single-predictor threshold regression models were used to evaluate the possibility of diminishing marginal returns from increased sample size or entity density.
            
            
              Results
              Fine-tuned models ranged in topline {NER} performance from F1-score=0.79 to F1-score=0.96 across architectures. Two-predictor multiple linear regression models were statistically significant with multiple R2 ranging from 0.6057 to 0.7896 (all P{\textless}.001). {EPS} and the number of sentences were significant predictors of F1-scores in all cases ( P{\textless}.001), except for the {GPT}-2\_large model, where {EPS} was not a significant predictor (P=.184). Model thresholds indicate points of diminishing marginal return from increased training data set sample size measured by the number of sentences, with point estimates ranging from 439 sentences for {RoBERTa}\_large to 527 sentences for {GPT}-2\_large. Likewise, the threshold regression models indicate a diminishing marginal return for {EPS} with point estimates between 1.36 and 1.38.
            
            
              Conclusions
              Relatively modest sample sizes can be used to fine-tune {LLMs} for {NER} tasks applied to biomedical text, and training data entity density should representatively approximate entity density in production data. Training data quality and a model architecture‚Äôs intended use (text generation vs text processing or classification) may be as, or more, important as training data volume and model parameter size.},

Type 1 {COI} are associated with a 1.1-1.8\% increase in the number of adverse events, serious events, hospitalizations, and deaths. Type 2 {COI} are associated with a 1.7-2\% decrease in adverse events across severity levels. Type 3 {COI} are associated with an approximately 1\% increase in adverse events, serious events, and hospitalizations, but have no significant association with adverse events resulting in death.

	abstract = {Recent outbreaks of measles have centered in specific communities, pointing to the influence of social ties on vaccination practices. This study adds to the conversation on public understanding of vaccine-related science, documenting how the individualist epistemologies highlighted in prior research are externalized and validated in communication with others, focusing on how the narrative strategies used to do so contribute to community building among vaccine refusing and hesitant parents. Through qualitative content analysis of testimonials given to the creators of the anti-vaccination documentary {VaxXed}, we identify how the common narrative strategies used to question the scientific consensus on vaccines‚Äîdistrust of doctors, self-diagnosis, building credibility, advocacy, and community building‚Äîbuild a competing consensus based on personal expertise. With this approach, we are better able to understand how participation in online communities strengthens the privileging of individualist epistemologies among vaccine refusing and hesitant parents.},

The paper draws on lines of scholarship in the digital humanities and computational rhetoric ‚Äì primarily, sequential structuring of semantic contexts, semantic parsing of unstructured text, and diachronic tracking of textual expressions ‚Äì to extend their conceptual and methodological insights into a computational framework for assessing rhetorical effectiveness. It offers a test case for this concept through an analysis of how Congress has framed human agency toward addressing climate change.},
