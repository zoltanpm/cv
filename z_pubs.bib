	abstract = {Recent outbreaks of measles have centered in specific communities, pointing to the influence of social ties on vaccination practices. This study adds to the conversation on public understanding of vaccine-related science, documenting how the individualist epistemologies highlighted in prior research are externalized and validated in communication with others, focusing on how the narrative strategies used to do so contribute to community building among vaccine refusing and hesitant parents. Through qualitative content analysis of testimonials given to the creators of the anti-vaccination documentary VaxXed, we identify how the common narrative strategies used to question the scientific consensus on vaccines—distrust of doctors, self-diagnosis, building credibility, advocacy, and community building—build a competing consensus based on personal expertise. With this approach, we are better able to understand how participation in online communities strengthens the privileging of individualist epistemologies among vaccine refusing and hesitant parents.},

The paper draws on lines of scholarship in the digital humanities and computational rhetoric – primarily, sequential structuring of semantic contexts, semantic parsing of unstructured text, and diachronic tracking of textual expressions – to extend their conceptual and methodological insights into a computational framework for assessing rhetorical effectiveness. It offers a test case for this concept through an analysis of how Congress has framed human agency toward addressing climate change.},

We used a machine-learning system to extract and classify COI from PubMed-indexed disclosure statements. Individual conflicts were classified as Type 1 (personal fees, travel, board memberships, and non-financial support), Type 2 (grants and research support), or Type 3 (stock ownership and industry employment). COI were aggregated by type compared to adverse events by product. Type 1 COI are associated with a 1.1-1.8\% increase in the number of adverse events, serious events, hospitalizations, and deaths. Type 2 COI are associated with a 1.7-2\% decrease in adverse events across severity levels. Type 3 COI are associated with an approximately 1\% increase in adverse events, serious events, and hospitalizations, but have no significant association with adverse events resulting in death. The findings suggest that COI policies might be adapted to account the relative risks of different types of financial relationships.},
