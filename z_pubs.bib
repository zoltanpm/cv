              Considerable efforts have been devoted to addressing the problem of conflicts of interest (COI) in health research, policy, education, and practice. An overwhelming body of evidence demonstrates that conflicts associate with deleterious outcomes for the biomedical research enterprise. Nevertheless, little has changed for research, specifically, since the Institute of Medicine's landmark
              Conflicts of Interest in Medical Research, Practice, and Education
              was published over a decade ago. In this article, we draw on interdisciplinary research on manufactured controversies in science‐policy deliberation to argue that the development of meaningful COI policy has been stymied through argumentative “wedges” designed to delay consensus and policy formation. Argumentative wedges disrupt policy formation by mischaracterizing the evidence base, continuously redefining the terms of the debate and/or recommending overly narrow criteria for who should be allowed to participate in policy deliberation. In this article, we argue researchers and policymakers interested in better addressing the harmful effects of COI can improve their efforts through strategic efforts designed to disrupt the wedges of manufactured controversy. Additionally, we argue that efforts to address COI can be further enhanced through embracing a broader framework for COI inquiry. Specifically, we argue that aggregate approaches to COI can help to disrupt these wedges and provide a strong foundation for future policy.

            摘要
            为了解决卫生研究、政策、教育和实践中的利益冲突(COI)问题，人们付出了巨大的努力。大量证据表明，冲突与生物医学研究企业的有害结果相关。然而，自十多年前医学研究所出版具有里程碑意义的《医学研究、实践和教育的利益冲突》以来，研究几乎没有发生任何变化。本文中，我们利用关于“科学‐政策审议中捏造的争议”的跨学科研究，提出论证:有意义的利益冲突政策的发展因一系列旨在延迟共识和政策形成的争论性“楔子”而受到阻碍。我们进一步论证，通过采用更广泛的探究框架，能有效地增强围绕利益冲突的研究和决策，以解决这些争论楔子。具体而言，我们认为利益冲突的综合方法有助于打破这些楔子，并为未来政策提供坚实的基础。

            Resumen
            Se han dedicado esfuerzos considerables a abordar el problema de los conflictos de intereses (COI) en la investigación, las políticas, la educación y la práctica de la salud. Una abrumadora cantidad de evidencia demuestra que los conflictos se asocian con resultados perjudiciales para la empresa de investigación biomédica. Sin embargo, poco ha cambiado para la investigación, específicamente, desde que el Instituto de Medicina publicó el histórico Conflictos de intereses en la investigación, la práctica y la educación médicas hace más de una década. En este artículo, nos basamos en investigaciones interdisciplinarias sobre controversias fabricadas en la deliberación científico‐política para argumentar que el desarrollo de políticas significativas en materia de COI se ha visto obstaculizado por “cuñas” argumentativas diseñadas para retrasar el consenso y la formación de políticas. Sostenemos además que la investigación y la formulación de políticas en torno a la COI se pueden aumentar de manera productiva para abordar estas brechas argumentativas mediante la adopción de un marco de investigación más amplio. Específicamente, sostenemos que los enfoques agregados de la COI pueden ayudar a romper estas brechas y proporcionar una base sólida para políticas futuras.

            Key Points
            
              
                
                  The development of meaningful conflicts of interest (COI) policy has been slowed through argumentative “wedges” that delay consensus and policy formation.
                
                
                  These wedges continuously re‐define COI, re‐establish the facts about the effects of COI, and reframe relevant value considerations while limiting the eligible policy discussants.
                
                
                  The effects of these wedges can be blunted through a stronger research and policy focus on aggregate and non‐individualized approaches to COI.},

	abstract = {Background
              Large language models (LLMs) have the potential to support promising new applications in health informatics. However, practical data on sample size considerations for fine-tuning LLMs to perform specific tasks in biomedical and health policy contexts are lacking.
            
            
              Objective
              This study aims to evaluate sample size and sample selection techniques for fine-tuning LLMs to support improved named entity recognition (NER) for a custom data set of conflicts of interest disclosure statements.
            
            
              Methods
              A random sample of 200 disclosure statements was prepared for annotation. All “PERSON” and “ORG” entities were identified by each of the 2 raters, and once appropriate agreement was established, the annotators independently annotated an additional 290 disclosure statements. From the 490 annotated documents, 2500 stratified random samples in different size ranges were drawn. The 2500 training set subsamples were used to fine-tune a selection of language models across 2 model architectures (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers [BERT] and Generative Pre-trained Transformer [GPT]) for improved NER, and multiple regression was used to assess the relationship between sample size (sentences), entity density (entities per sentence [EPS]), and trained model performance (F1-score). Additionally, single-predictor threshold regression models were used to evaluate the possibility of diminishing marginal returns from increased sample size or entity density.
            
            
              Results
              Fine-tuned models ranged in topline NER performance from F1-score=0.79 to F1-score=0.96 across architectures. Two-predictor multiple linear regression models were statistically significant with multiple R2 ranging from 0.6057 to 0.7896 (all P{\textless}.001). EPS and the number of sentences were significant predictors of F1-scores in all cases ( P{\textless}.001), except for the GPT-2\_large model, where EPS was not a significant predictor (P=.184). Model thresholds indicate points of diminishing marginal return from increased training data set sample size measured by the number of sentences, with point estimates ranging from 439 sentences for RoBERTa\_large to 527 sentences for GPT-2\_large. Likewise, the threshold regression models indicate a diminishing marginal return for EPS with point estimates between 1.36 and 1.38.
            
            
              Conclusions
              Relatively modest sample sizes can be used to fine-tune LLMs for NER tasks applied to biomedical text, and training data entity density should representatively approximate entity density in production data. Training data quality and a model architecture’s intended use (text generation vs text processing or classification) may be as, or more, important as training data volume and model parameter size.},

COI were aggregated by type compared to adverse events by product. Type 1 COI are associated with a 1.1-1.8\% increase in the number of adverse events, serious events, hospitalizations, and deaths. Type 2 COI are associated with a 1.7-2\% decrease in adverse events across severity levels. Type 3 COI are associated with an approximately 1\% increase in adverse events, serious events, and hospitalizations, but have no significant association with adverse events resulting in death. The findings suggest that COI policies might be adapted to account the relative risks of different types of financial relationships.},

This study adds to the conversation on public understanding of vaccine-related science, documenting how the individualist epistemologies highlighted in prior research are externalized and validated in communication with others, focusing on how the narrative strategies used to do so contribute to community building among vaccine refusing and hesitant parents. Through qualitative content analysis of testimonials given to the creators of the anti-vaccination documentary VaxXed, we identify how the common narrative strategies used to question the scientific consensus on vaccines—distrust of doctors, self-diagnosis, building credibility, advocacy, and community building—build a competing consensus based on personal expertise. With this approach, we are better able to understand how participation in online communities strengthens the privileging of individualist epistemologies among vaccine refusing and hesitant parents.},
